Introduction
============

J branch is the Javascript implementation of webCommander server.

NodeJS is adopted for web server so that webCommander could run
on Windows, Linux and OSX.

AngularJS is adopted for client UI so that webCommander has better
support for more types of browsers including mobile ones.

Sample Powershell scripts included may not work on Linux or
OSX currently. Cross platform support will be added later.
